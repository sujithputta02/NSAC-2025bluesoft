# Alternative Deployment Options

## üö® Vercel Issue: 250MB Serverless Function Limit

Your full dependencies (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.) exceed Vercel's 250MB limit for serverless functions.

## üöÄ Recommended Alternatives

### 1. Railway (Recommended)
**Pros**: No size limits, easy deployment, great for full-stack apps
**Cons**: Paid service after free tier

#### Deploy to Railway:
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Railway will auto-detect and deploy both frontend and backend
4. Uses `railway.json` configuration (already created)
5. Supports all your dependencies without limits

#### Railway Setup:
```bash
# Install Railway CLI (optional)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Deploy (or use web interface)
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

### 2. Render
**Pros**: Free tier available, no size limits, Docker support
**Cons**: Slower cold starts

#### Deploy to Render:
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Create "Web Service" 
4. Use Docker deployment with provided Dockerfile
5. Set environment variables in Render dashboard

### 3. Fly.io
**Pros**: Global edge deployment, Docker support
**Cons**: More complex setup

#### Deploy to Fly.io:
```bash
# Install Fly CLI
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Deploy
fly launch
fly deploy
```

### 4. DigitalOcean App Platform
**Pros**: Simple deployment, good pricing
**Cons**: Less features than others

### 5. Heroku
**Pros**: Classic PaaS, well-documented
**Cons**: No free tier anymore

## üìÅ Files Created for Alternative Deployment

- ‚úÖ `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- ‚úÖ `Dockerfile` - Docker deployment for any platform
- ‚úÖ `requirements-full.txt` - All dependencies for non-Vercel platforms
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` - Minimal for Vercel (current)

## üîÑ Quick Switch Between Platforms

### For Vercel (current setup):
- Uses `requirements.txt` (minimal dependencies)
- Limited functionality but works within 250MB limit

### For Railway/Render/Others:
```bash
# Switch to full requirements
cp requirements-full.txt requirements.txt
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Switch to full dependencies for Railway deployment"
git push
```

## üéØ Recommendation

**Use Railway** - it's the easiest migration from Vercel:
1. Same GitHub integration
2. Automatic deployments
3. No size limits
4. Full functionality with all your dependencies
5. Great developer experience

Your NASA weather app will work perfectly with all features enabled!

## üîß Environment Variables

All the same environment variables from Vercel work on these platforms:
```
NASA_EARTHDATA_USERNAME=sujithputta
NASA_EARTHDATA_PASSWORD=Nasa@12345t$
METEOMATICS_USERNAME=kakarla_vikas
METEOMATICS_PASSWORD=mW07QKj9y7ApKf23Ep43
METEOMATICS_CUTOFF=2025-10-12T23:59:59Z
```
